# The Last Samurai. Part I

They say Japan was made by a sword.

They say thd old gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean and when they pulled it out, four perfect drops fell back into the sea, and those drops became the islands of Japan.

I say Japan was made by a handful of brave man, warriors willing to give their lives for what seems to have become a forgotten word, Honor.
